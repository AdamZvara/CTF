# Description

I thought of this really cool collision free hash function and hashed the flag with it. Theoretically you shouldn't be able to reverse it...

# Solution

We are given a binary file and a hash file and the goal is to reverse the hash and get the flag. The hash is 
`4717591a4e08732410215579264e7e0956320367384171045b28187402316e1a7243300f501946325a6a1f7810643b0a7e21566257083c63043404603f5763563e43`.

After opening the binary in ghidra I found out that this function is responsible for creating the hash:

The function is really simple: first, it copies the flag into new buffer and then each letter (apart from the first) is 
XORed with the previous letter. Iâ€™ve made this little python script to get the flag from the hash file
```python
from binascii import unhexlify

with open("hash", "r") as f:
    flag = f.read().strip()

flag = unhexlify(flag)

solved = "G"

for i in range(len(flag)-1):
    solved += chr(flag[i] ^ flag[i-1])

print(solved)
```
